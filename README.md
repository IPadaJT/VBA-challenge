# VBA-Module2 Challenge

## Goals
1. The purpose of this assignment was to create a script that loops through the data and output:
ticker, yearly change, percent change, and stock volume.

In addition, the assignment asked that this script run on every worksheet and that there was conditional formatting for the data.

2. Afterwards, the assignment challenged us to create functionality by making a script(s) that would return the stock with the greatest increase, greatest decrease and greatest volume

## VBS files
- Module2.vbs: This is the script responsible for conditional formatting, sorting and outputting the required data for each worksheet as outlined in Goal 1
- MaxFunctionality.vbs: This is the script responsible for finding the greatest % increase for each worksheet
- minFunctionality.vbs: This is the script responsible for finding the greatest % decrease for each worksheet
- volFunctionality.vbs: This is the script responsible for finding the greatest total volume for each worksheet
